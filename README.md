The parser takes as arguments the names of the model files (without extension) that will be generated into python code.
The files need to be in the models folder and have the .aim extension.
It will then generate python files with the same name in the generated folder.

For example: python parser.py tikTakToe or python parser.py tikTakToe towersOfHanoi
